# Statistics-in-Python-ANOVA
Basic Statistics in Python - Performing Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

This project is for people who are interested in statistics, particularly carrying our statistical analysis in Python. In this project we will be focusing on the data
set from the World Bank, which is on education, specifically around the percentage of females which are unemployed in different country groups.
We will use python to create plots so that we can visualize our results. 
We will also be performing ANOVA on different groups and using box plots to visualize the results of that analysis.

__Data Source:__ *https://data.worldbank.org/topic/education?cid=EXT_TWBN_D_EXT*

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	Merge, sort and transform data prior to analysis.
2.	Clean the data, remove null values to prepare it for statistical analysis and extract descriptive statistics on the data.
3.	Perform ANOVA to compare groups of data.
4.	Create boxplots to show outliers.

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Short intro to Python.
- __Task 2:__ Load libraries and download data from the World Bank website.
- __Task 3:__ Sort and merge two datasets
- __Task 4:__ Clean missing data and exploratory data analysis.
- __Task 5:__ Perform Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).
- __Task 6:__ Create boxplots.
